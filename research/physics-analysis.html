                <h3>The Standard Model</h3>
                <p>The Standard Model is our current reigning theory for describing the tiniest building blocks of the universe. 
                    <!-- As a linchpin of the Standard Model, the Higgs boson describes how these fundamental particles acquire mass.  -->
                And yet… somehow the Standard Model seems to leave us with more questions than answers… such as: 
                    <i>What is the nature of dark matter?
                    Could the structure encoded in the particles and their interactions hold a clue to a deeper theory? How do neutrinos
                    get their mass?</i> and <i>How could gravity fit into this quantum story?</i> </p>

                Due to the centrality of the Higgs boson in the Standard Model, understanding its properties and interactions is key to answering these questions.

        <!-- The shape of the Higgs potential encodes 
        <!-- the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and  -->
        <!-- the origin of mass. 
        Any deviation from the expected shape could indicate new physics beyond the
        Standard Model, such as new particles or forces that couple to the Higgs field. 
        Therefore, precise measurements of the Higgs potential are crucial for testing the Standard Model and probing for new physics. -->

            <h3>The Higgs Potential</h3>
            The particles that mediate the weak force get their mass from interactions with the Higgs boson, or more specifically
            its field<sup>1</sup>. This field has a potential energy, known as the <strong style="color: navy;">Higgs
                potential</strong> (figure below). While V(φ) is symmetric about φ=0, its large value at φ=0 is an unstable
            equilibrium. Through <em>electroweak symmetry breaking</em> (EWSB) our universe "rolls down" this potential hill to
            select a new local extremum in which the weak bosons acquire mass. This theory necessitates the existence of a new
            massive particle, the Higgs boson, experimentally discovered in 2012 at the LHC.</p>
            
            <p>While this formula for the Higgs potential offers a consistent description for the matter content of the universe, it
                is merely an ansatz which has yet to be experimentally verified. Due to the centrality of the Higgs in particle
                physics and implications of this potential for the future stability of the universe, <strong>understanding the
                    nature of EWSB is key to understanding nature, and one of the most pressing questions in particle
                    physics.</strong></p>

                <h3>Di-Higgs Production (HH)</h3>
                <p>A first measurement of this potential could be obtained by the simultaneous production of two Higgs bosons (``di-Higgs’'
                or HH), an exceptionally rare process. Of the 40 million proton-proton collisions that happen each second at the LHC, <i>we
                simultaneously produce two Higgs bosons only once per hour</pi>.
                Different shapes for the potential would give different HH production rates and kinematics, providing a clear signal if
                this potential deviates from the current expection.</p>

        <p>
            The central challenge to this analysis is estimating the all hadronic background, 
            which is challenging to simulate from first principles.
            In the above paper, we used a NN to reweight between two distributions.

            The details of this method are in the last <a href="{{ '/assets/Hartman_flows.pdf' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">chapter of my PhD thesis</a>
